*Fun facts: Did you know that...
- ...spiders have exactly one heart?
- ...spiders eat more insects than birds and bats combined?
- ...spiders are not insects, but belong to a group called the arachnids
- ...when a spider travels it always has 4 legs on and 4 legs off the ground
- ...In a bottle of sparkling wine are about 49 million bubbles! So the next time you’re wondering how many bubbles they’re in your glass, you know that counting them is something you can maybe save for another time.
- ...Believe it or not, according to science, soap bubbles don’t actually fly – they float!
- ...If a bubble isn’t popped on purpose, it will eventually pop naturally as the water molecules evaporate leaving the outer layer of the bubble too thin to maintain the surface tension.
